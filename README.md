# ABOUT FLOW

## “Our art tells a story and our stories should be listened to as we intended..”
Adele,  Nov. 21st, 2021

There is a desire for artists to tell stories, express their emotions, and take people with them on this journey.
More than just an art, music is for both the artist and the listener a way to express and process emotions. 

## Flow is a 100% React App, based on the growing concept of “musicotherapy”. 

In psychology, the term “Flow” designate a mental state, reached when fully imersed, mindfully, in an activity with a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment. 

Music triggers emotions modulated by various parameters. For that the user of Flow has the possibility of choosing his inspiration of the day, based on emotional key words such as Peace, Joy, Love, Active, etc. 

While going through the album, they can dive into the lyrics and get very close to the meaning and message conveid by the artist.
Flow is also unique and offers everyone the opportunity to express their emotions and tell their own story. 
Listen to the music, and share with others and with the artist how does it make you feel. Be creative, you can write stories, poems, or kind of ways that will give you the opportunity to release your emotions. 

Share with others what other songs you'll suggest based on what you just listened to and vote for your favorite. 

Just let it flow -
